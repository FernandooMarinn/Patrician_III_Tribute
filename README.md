# Patrician_III_Tribute
Patrician III game tribute in python.

This is a tribute to one of my childhood games, Patrician III.
It is a simplified game, written completely in python, that tries to emulate the original game.

It was made for practising programming, and in the proccess I fall in love with python and OOP. One day I will come back, and make it much better.

If you are reading this. Thank you! Feel free to ask, try the game, and of course let me know if you 
experiment any bug, so i can fix it.
