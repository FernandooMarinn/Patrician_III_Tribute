# Patrician_III_Tribute
Patrician III game tribute in python.

This is a tribute to one of my childhood games, Patrician III.
It is a simplified game, written completely in python, that tries to emulate the original game.

## About the game.

-The original game is about naval trade between cities in the Hanseatic League, between 1300 and 1400.

-It work with turns rather than days. This seems more fit for the terminal enviroment.

-Each round a bill is passed on (depending on the current money), and also the fleet wears out each turn, and coins have to be invested in repairing it. This is done in order to balance out the money gain, which is very easy after a certain point.

-You have to watch out for pirates!

-The number of ships can be increased in order to carry more goods at the same time.

## Conclusion.

It was made for practising programming, and in the proccess I fall in love with python and OOP. One day I will come back, and make it much better.

If you are reading this. Thank you! Feel free to ask, try the game, and of course let me know if you 
experiment any bug, so i can fix it.
